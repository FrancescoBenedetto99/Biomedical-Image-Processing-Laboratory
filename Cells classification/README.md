## Overview  
This exercise involves the analysis of a microscopic image (**plasma.jpg**) containing plasmatic cells. The goal is to identify and segment:  
1. **Normal cells**: Characterized by small, blue nuclei.  
2. **Atypical cells**: Distinguished by enlarged nuclei (nucleomegaly) and a non-uniform pink color.  

The task requires developing a segmentation algorithm to:
- Separate and count the normal and atypical cells.
- Compute clinical parameters such as:
  - **Area**  
  - **Eccentricity**  
  - **Standard deviation (SD) of video intensity**  

These parameters are provided as **mean Â± SD**.
