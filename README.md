## Projects in this Repository

### **1. Knee Osteoarthritis Classification**
   - **Goal**: Classifying knee X-ray images to detect and grade osteoarthritis severity using both handcrafted features (e.g., SVM, ensemble trees) and deep learning models (e.g., MobileNet, AlexNet).
   - This project analyzes knee X-ray images to classify the severity of osteoarthritis using multiple models. Classical approaches are combined with deep learning techniques to achieve robust performance.

### **2. Cells Segmentation and Classification**
   - **Goal**: Segmentation of normal and atypical plasmatic cells in a microscopic image.
   - This project involves identifying and segmenting normal and atypical cells based on their morphological features such as area, eccentricity, and intensity variations.

### **3. Edge Detection and Segmentation Using Compass Masks and Morphological Operators**
   - **Goal**: Segmenting an image to extract contours of squares inside circles using edge enhancement and Sobel compass masks.
   - This project applies edge enhancement techniques, followed by Sobel filters, to extract contours and segment complex structures in biomedical images.

### **4. Homomorphic Filtering Procedure**
   - **Goal**: Applying homomorphic filtering to enhance images in the frequency domain.
   - This project involves using homomorphic filtering to improve the quality of medical images by reducing noise and enhancing the contrast in both low and high-frequency components.

### **5. Noise Identification and Filtering**
   - **Goal**: Identifying and removing noise from corrupted images using custom filtering solutions.
   - This project focuses on detecting the type of noise in biomedical images (e.g., Gaussian, Salt and Pepper) and applying appropriate filtering techniques to improve image quality.
